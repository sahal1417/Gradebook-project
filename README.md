# GradeBook Project
__________________________________

## Objective:

One of the jobs that all teachers have in common is evaluating students. You usually have to turn students’ scores into a letter grade at the end of the term. This often involves a bunch of calculations that you might do in a spreadsheet. Instead, you can consider using Python and pandas.
One problem with using a spreadsheet is that it can be hard to see when you make a mistake in a formula. Maybe you selected the wrong column and put quizzes where exams should go. Maybe you found the maximum of two incorrect values.

***To solve this problem I've focused mainly on data cleaning activities, I used Python and pandas to do all your calculations and find and fix those mistakes much faster with better accuracy.***

##### Main steps to acheive this,

- Load and explore data from multiple sources with pandas
- Clean DataFrame using Numpy and Pandas
- Merge data in a pandas DataFrame
- Calculate grades, filter and group in a pandas DataFrame
- Plotting Summary Statistics

*Once we complete these steps, we’ll have the grades in a format that we should be able to upload to the school’s student administration system.*


## Guidelines to use the script:
1st/ Download the project and run it using Jupyter Notebook. To install the required dependency, please do the followings,
- [Install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation) if you don't have installed it on your device
- Run the following command on cmd within the same project directory,
  -  Installing jupyter notebook by running: "pip install notebook" on cmd
  -  Installing pandas and numpy by: "pip install pandas" on cmd
  -  Installing patplotlib (visualization) by: "pip install matplotlib" on cmd
2nd/ )pen the "final_gradebook" file where you will find source code with the documentation.

*Note' to run the python file you can type onto cmd "jupyter notebook" within the same project path.*
